A web app for view some dogs and cats photo.

### API
I used some API's to get all the images
- https://thedogapi.com/
- https://thecatapi.com/

### Features
Basically i use http request and save all the favs images on local storage

### Tech
All the project was created with Angular 13 and Angular Material

### Suggestion

If you want to get some additional info as breeds information or something with http request, i recomend to sign up on API's website to get your own key.
